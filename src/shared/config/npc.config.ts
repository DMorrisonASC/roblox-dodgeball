	 * server is the machine driving every `MoveTo` a rig makes, and the one measuring the speed its

	 * A rig that has had it taken is a rig whose physics is being simulated by whichever client is
	 * nearest, and the symptoms are a rig that jitters underfoot and a `MoveTo` that stops arriving:
	 * exactly when a player is close enough to be watching. `GetNetworkOwnershipAuto` is the engine's
	 * own statement that the decision can be automatic, which is why this is a re-check rather than
	 * one call at spawn.
	 *
	 * **Five seconds, and it is cheap enough not to be clever about.** The check is one
	 * `GetNetworkOwner` per rig per interval, inside a loop that already runs several times a second
	 * per rig, and what it is protecting is a walk and a destination.
