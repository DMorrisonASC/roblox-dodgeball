 * {@link isCatching} when a ball touches a catchable part, and {@link consume}s
 * the window so one attempt catches one ball.
 *

 * humanoid — an NPC differs from a player's character in nothing but the player
 * behind it — so the player path is just the remote handler below, which hands us
 * the model, and an NPC's AI makes the very same call directly.
